# SpeedCode Challenge: Parallel String Sort

Can you optimize your sorting algorithm to make it run as fast as possible on
large datasets using parallel computing techniques? Remember, the goal is to not
only sort correctly but also to leverage parallelism for speed. Good luck!

## Problem Statement

Given a list of strings, your task is to sort the list in ascending order. However, there's a twist! This is not just about writing a sorting algorithm; it's about optimizing it using parallel computing techniques. Your solution should leverage the power of parallelism to efficiently sort the list of strings.

### Input:

- A vector of strings `input`: A list containing `n` strings.

### Output:

- Return a vector of strings, sorted in ascending order.

### Example:

**Input:** `["pear", "apple", "orange", "grape"]`

**Output:** `["apple", "grape", "orange", "pear"]`

## Constraints:

- The number of strings `n` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each string's length will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- Strings consist of lowercase English letters.

## Function Signature (C++)

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> solution_entry(std::vector<std::string> &input);
```

## Hints for Optimization

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, but when it comes to
handling large datasets, efficiency becomes key. Here are some hints to optimize
your sorting algorithm:

**Parallel Algorithms:** Consider using parallel sorting algorithms like parallel merge sort or parallel quicksort. These algorithms divide the data into smaller subsets, sort them in parallel, and then combine the results.

**Divide and Conquer:** Implement a divide-and-conquer approach where the problem is divided into smaller subproblems, processed independently, and then combined. This approach is highly effective in parallel processing.

**OpenCilk Framework:** Utilize the OpenCilk framework for parallelism in C++. OpenCilk provides constructs like cilk_spawn and cilk_sync which are instrumental in creating parallel code.

**Load Balancing:** Ensure that the workload is evenly distributed among the threads. Uneven distribution can lead to some threads doing more work than others, which can reduce overall efficiency.

**Avoiding Overhead:** Be aware of the overheads introduced by parallelism. For smaller datasets, the overhead might outweigh the benefits. Implement a threshold below which the algorithm defaults to a sequential sort.

**Memory Access Patterns:** Pay attention to the memory access patterns. Efficient use of cache and reducing cache misses can significantly speed up sorting operations.
